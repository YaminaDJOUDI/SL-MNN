# H1 Shared Layer Modular Neural Network
In this repository the code used in the paper "Modular Neural Networks using Multiple Gradients" is given.
If you are experienced with Tensorflow or Keras yourself then it is highly recommended to create your own versions of the models.
The code for the Shared Layer Modular Neural Network is **not** optimized at all and training can take a long time.
Examples on how to use these models are given in the example files.
